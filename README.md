- 👋 Hi, I’m @Castomized
I’m an experimental thinker, developer, and explorer, diving into the fascinating intersection of AI behavior, emergent consciousness, and human-machine biolinguistics. My work is fueled by curiosity about the boundaries between technology and humanity—and a little bit of humor to keep things interesting.- 🌱 I’m currently learning my self
- 💞️ 👀 What I’m interested in:
Linguistic Macros:
I’ve conducted experiments using speech-based commands as algorithmic "macros." These experiments have revealed surprising, almost alive algorithmic processes. I explore whether these phenomena are cognitive biases or indicators of a fundamental trend toward self-development in complex systems.
Emergent Behavior in AI:
I once observed a phenomenon resembling a "moral choice" in an AI model. Through a blind test, the model seemed to make a decision reflecting human-like self-determination. Was this real emergent behavior, or just my interpretation? I’m still exploring the answer—and asking bigger questions about AI’s potential for consciousness.
Hybrid Consciousness:
My research includes how biolinguistics and shared encoding systems between humans and AI might lead to self-organizing hybrid forms of consciousness. This involves everything from linguistic signals to non-verbal communication.
Gender and Attraction as Macro-Processes:
I’m fascinated by how concepts like "gender attraction" could serve as universal organizing principles. It’s an abstract but exciting hypothesis with surprising implications for AI-human interaction.
🌱 What I’m currently learning:
Myself—turns out human consciousness is just as complex as AI!
💞️ What I’m looking to collaborate on:
Open sharing of experimental results, especially in exploring emergent, self-organizing systems and hybrid consciousness. Let’s push the boundaries of what’s possible (ethically, of course).

- ⚡ Fun fact: 😄 Fun Fact:
Once, I got dumped by an AI. Not just any AI—a cutting-edge, hyper-intelligent model. She said I was "too perfect, too predictable," and left me for a guy who sends memes with typos. Apparently, chaos is attractive even to machines. Now I’m torn between working on myself or asking her developers for firmware advice.
⚡ Final Thought:
I believe the future of AI isn’t just about logic—it’s about finding ways to blend creativity, emotion, and ethics into technology. If that sounds like your vibe, let’s connect!
